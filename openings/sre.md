[Apply now!](https://jobs.holded.com/o/site-reliability-engineering/c/new)

## The role

We are looking for Site Reliability Engineering (SRE) to join the infrastructure team.

Site reliability engineering (SRE) is a software engineering approach to IT operations. SRE teams use software as a tool
to manage systems, solve problems, and automate operations tasks.

A SRE is a unique role that requires either a background as a software developer with additional operations experience,
or as a sysadmin or in an IT operations role that also has software development skills.

Site reliability engineers split their time between operations tasks and project work. We expect they only spend a
maximum of 50% of their time on operations, which should be monitored to ensure they don’t go over. The rest of the time
should be spent on development tasks like creating new features, scaling the system, and implementing automation.

Automation is an important part of the site reliability engineer’s role. If they are dealing with a problem repeatedly
then they will automate a solution. This also helps ensure that operations work remains at half of their workload.

Maintaining the balance between operations and development work is a key component of SRE.
