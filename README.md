# About us

Holded was founded in 2016 by Javi Fondevila and Bernat Ripoll, who met each other on Facebook with the idea of
reinventing ERP for small businesses, a very crowded space with invoicing, accounting tools, CRMs and much more. Their
obsession with creating the best product allowed them to become one of the most popular startups in Europe and the
fastest-growing software company in their home market Spain. In 4 years they managed to onboard more than 80 000
businesses.

From June 2021, Holded is part of the [Visma](https://www.visma.com/) group, **one of Europe's leading technology
companies**, with thousands of employees across 21 countries and **over 4,000 developers**.

We deliver software that simplifies and digitises core business processes in the private and public sectors. By helping
one million customers run their business every day, we give companies a competitive edge and individuals time to focus
on what they love. The Visma Group is active throughout the Scandinavian region, along with the Benelux, Central, and
Eastern Europe.

# Our vision

Our mission in the Holded technology and product teams is to innovate and create software that helps organisations run
better while building a more sustainable future.

We use product and technology as the pillar to grow and make customers happy. We want to create the best platform to
help small businesses and accounting offices digitise and automate to boost productivity.
